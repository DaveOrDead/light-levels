# Light Levels

[![Travis][build-badge]][build] [![npm package][npm-badge]][npm] [![Coveralls][coveralls-badge]][coveralls]

A vanilla javascript plugin for polyfilling the [light-level CSS @media feature].

This media feature can be used to adjust styles based on the ambient light level - however since it's from a relatively recent Working Draft, it currently has zero browser support.

This polyfill detects ambient light levels and applies a corresponding class name to the `<body>` element in order to emulate the same behaviour today.

It is recommended to combine this plugin with the PostCSS plugin [postcss-light-levels] which allows you to write the upcoming syntax but uses it to generate class names which correlate to the ones generated by this library..

It is worth nothing that both this JS library and PostCSS plugin can be used independently if you wish.
